# Swipe - Guided Project

## Description

This is a single web page application using HTML, advanced CSS features, and a
JavaScript animated gradient. This was created by [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt) as the final
project in his
[HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2023 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/html-and-css-bootcamp/)
course on Udemy. I adapted changes to fine tune the application and ensure that
it was responsive across multiple breakpoints. It features positioning to create
angled backgrounds, transitions, pseudo-elements and flexbox. The animated
gradient is an open-source code pen using WebGL.

## Installation

No Installation Required.
The website is deployed and can be viewed at [Swipe](https://christinelea.github.io/swipe-guided-project/)

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to
have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while
providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to
reasonably include in the README.
The source code for HTML, CSS and the JavaScript gradient can be viewed in the GitHub repository.
**CSS Features** can be viewed in the index.css file.
**CSS variables** Lines 1 - 50, **Angled Background using ::before ::after** Lines 442 - 464 & Lines 523 - 543,
**Angled "Swipe" Card using transform, position & ::before** Lines 614 - 672,
**Hamburger Button** *(See Roadmap for more information)* Lines 857 - 884.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue
tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in
the README.
@keyframe animation will be added to the hamburger button which displays in the nav bar when the screen is less than 768px wide.

## Authors and acknowledgment

I would like to acknowledge [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt) as the creator of this guided project which I completed during his HTML & CSS 2023 Bootcamp Edition course. I have made updates to the media queries so that the application has a more appealing responsive layout.
